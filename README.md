# Object-Oriented Programming Class
#### Status : Ongoing
Here it is where I'm putting my resolution to the practice files given for my Object-Oriented Programming Class.

## Installation

This project is formatted as a Intellij Idea Project, because that's the IDE I'm currently using. 

For someone who doesn't use Intellij IDE, you can use this program using the source code available in the src folder.

## Usage

Using the program is quite simple... When you first run the program, it will ask you what is the number of the exercise you want to run and you simply put it in the terminal and hit enter.
Then, if the exercise you chose needs some input, it will tell you what it needs so you can put it in. If the exercise doesn't need input, it will tell you in the arguments with '( )' and will give you the answers directly as in the example below.
